# VBA_challenge

This project contains code for looping through mock stock data to aggregrate data from each ticker and calculate the total stock volume, the yearly change in stock prices, and the percentage change in stock prices from the opening date to the closing date. The range is from 2014 to 2016. Within the workflow folder you should find screenshots of a portion of the excel sheets, one per year, with conditional formatting included to show which tickers had positive growth throughout the year and which tickers had stock prices depreciate throughout the year. You should also find the VBA code that I used, including notes about what the segments of code are achieving.
